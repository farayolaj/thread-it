# Thread It

This is a note taking app that was inspired by Twitter threads. It also supports tagging each note and offline usage.

### Getting Started

This app uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), so you need to set up a Firebase project and register a web app. You can do that by following the doc [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#create-project).

After setting up Firebase, get the following details and set them in a `.env` file.

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
REACT_APP_APP_ID=
REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID=
```
